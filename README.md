# BeReal restAPI (not official)

-   You can read API docs [here]() (some routes are not working on swagger but only in it, yes in fetch, axios, postman...)
-   Is done by my [BeReal client](https://github.com/chemokita13/NodeBeFakeClient) (but with some changes)
-   Only I want if you use it, is one star ‚≠ê
-   Contact me for erros or explanation (my email is in my [gh profile](https://github.com/chemokita13))

---

## How to use it

-   Just check the API docs made by swagger (but dont try to execute the examples, try it in postman or something similar)

---

## Local instalation

-   Download the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chemokita13/beReal-api
cd beReal-api

npm run build
```
